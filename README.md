# Vocal visualizer

Record your vocals so I can do math on it!

**Story**

I recently started the [Audio signal processing for music applications](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing/home/) course and was discussing vocal analysis with a good friend. FFT is incredibly powerful, and we can learn a lot about vocal characteristics from it! Different vocal types can sing different styles better and are naturally suited to cover different artists and perform various genres. This project is a deep dive into analyzing all of that by first building a way to analyze your own vocals!
